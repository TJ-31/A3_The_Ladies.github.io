							<h3>Isabella</h3>
							<p>In this project, we all collaborated effectively with each other in order to get the project done efficiently. The tasks were distributed equally and were completed on time, before our designated deadline. As a group, I would say we have communicated very well over the 12 weeks. If anyone had any issues, we would message the group chat and someone was always available to help. One thing that could be improved is to organise more meetings on Microsoft Teams however this is difficult as everyone has different schedules and can be hard to find a time where it suits everyone.
							</p>
							<p>One thing I found very surprising was the level of communication within the group. We had all met in this class, none of us knew each other. However, we have all collaborated extremely well with each other both personally and as a group. I have learnt that when working in a group, the very first thing to do is break down the assignment and allocate each group member with a task/s. This way the responsibility is shared and can be evenly distributed.

							<h3>Ella</h3>
							<p>
								During this assignment, our team was able to work together efficiently but also do their sections individually. All members have been able to dedicate time to make it to team meetings twice a week as well as complete their designated sections with plenty of time ahead. We used what we had learnt about each other from previous assignments to help work together as best we can. Having a team with such great communication has helped us hugely throughout the project as everyone always says their part and feels comfortable enough to share concerns leading to the project being as best as it can be. 
							</p>
							<p>What really surprised me with our group is that everyone put in so much effort to ensure everything was always right. Every team member made sure their part was always done well and truly before the deadline as well as ensuring to make it to meetings even if they are very busy and have other things on. The honesty throughout the group really impressed me and helped the project massively as if someone felt a section could be better we were able to fix it before the submission.
							</p>

							<h3>Trisha</h3>
							<p>
								Throughout the process of completing our assignment, all the members participated equally by finishing the assigned tasks on given time as well as participating in weekly online and class meetings. This was the aspect that went really well in our group because all the members made communication easy which enabled us to get our work done efficiently and effectively. From the last assignment, we have picked up on the parts that didnâ€™t go well such as online meetings. So, since this assignment is also a group project with the same team members, we have tried to start the tasks with an appropriate plan first where a table has been inserted at the beginning of the report, showing all the tasks that needs to be done in a given time for each task. Additionally, a team member can then choose the task that they want to do. This allowed our team to work efficiently and get that task done in a designated time. Furthermore, our group has formed for more than 10 weeks now and our collaboration and cooperation with each other has stayed and is still continuing in a positive and friendly manner. This was surprising for me because our group has 5 members and I thought it might be hard to communicate and agree with each other. However, it was really easy to make decisions and come to conclusions with everyone in the group

							<h3>Sanushka</h3>
							<p>
							In this project we were able to strengthen our communication skills and work around any inconveniences together. We were able to divide up the heavy load of work evenly and everyone completed their sections in a timely manner and let everyone know if we had any issues. I think the only thing that could be improved is having more meetings to do more group work online rather than all in person. One thing that was surprising was our ability to communicate with one another throughout the whole project. I have learnt that in groups everyone should have the tasks divided evenly so that no one feels overwhelmed with the amount of work. 
							</p>

							<h3>Sahana</h3>
							<p>
								For this assignment, we were able to consolidate our skills in both creating our website as well as our prototype. We worked collaboratively to ensure that we completed the report, website and prototype on time. Since this milestone was heavily focussed on the project, each member ensured that they understood all the requirements of the prototype and built upon the ideas put forth in our previous milestone. One thing that we could improve on is ensuring that we follow our timeframe as closely as possible. An aspect that we worked on based off of feedback from our last milestone is our allocation of meetings as during this milestone. This time we had clear agendas for most of our meetings which enabled us to make any adjustments to our project in an effective manner. One thing that surprised us was our ability to adapt to challenges such as working with a new template for our project and debugging our html and css code. During this project, I have learnt that it is important to allocate not only tasks to each person but also time to complete these tasks to ensure that we have enough time to edit and seek feedback where necessary.

							<h3>Group Reflection</h3>
							<p>
								In this assignment we were able to strengthen our communication and collaboration skills with one another. We were able to allocate tasks to all group members evenly and were completed in a timely manner. Although we had a limited amount of time to complete the assignment we were still able to finish our work on time and helped one another with any issues that occurred. Our team was able to expand our idea of GiftIt and who would be involved in the creation/development of the application. While creating the prototype we were able to identify any possible issues with the design or functionality.
							</p>
							<p>
								A possible area for improvement would be the amount of online meetings and fixed date and time. However, this is understandable as everyone has their own personal and work commitments and it is difficult to schedule group meetings around that. We sometimes would be confused about certain sections of the projects which we could have clarified earlier on rather than later on, this would allow us to effortlessly complete our sections. However, we were still able to communicate with one another if we felt any confusion. 
							</p>
							<p>
								The first thing we found surprising was the amount of depth we had to go into with our project idea, we had only thought about our idea in a rough sense. In this project we were able to clearly identify what we wanted our application to look like and what functions would be necessary in the app. Another thing we found surprising was how well we worked together as a group despite not knowing each other previously. 
							</p>
							<p>
								We learnt that communication is the most important aspect of group work. It allowed us to finish our project with little to no issues. Another thing we learnt is that it is important to divide the work early on when beginning the project so that everyone knows what they need to do. It is also helpful to assign a time period when it should be completed, so that everyone stays on task.
